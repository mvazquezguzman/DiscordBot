# DiscordBot

# Fall 2023
## Description
- The plan is to automate the cleaning of a Discord server by creating a dedicated Discord bot. The bot will respond to a command and work on a set schedule. It will have configurable options, a customizable blacklist, and a preview feature to show which inactive members are going to be removed.

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Communication Tools
- Discord

## Repo Location
- [Repo Link](https://github.com/GGC-SD/DiscordBot.git)

## Progress Tracking Tool
- Jira
- [Progress tool Link](https://jira.ggc.edu/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=29&projectKey=SDAD&view=planning&selectedIssue=SDAD-249&epics=visible&issueLimit=100)

## Set Up
- Using your Operating Systems Terminal set the ExecutionPolicy. Use the command: Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser.
- The RemoteSigned is also a safe PowerShell Execution policy to set in an enterprise environment. This policy dictates that any script that was not created on the system that the script is running on, should be signed. Therefore, this will allow you to write your own script and execute it. You would not be able to run a script that was downloaded from the Internet, or got from a friend who wrote it under his account or on a different computer. PowerShell differentiates between script you wrote on that computer, and a script that came from elsewhere using the file metadata.
- (The scope makes the RemoteSigned only effect a single user instead of allowing all the users to become effected by the terminal command. This is a security precaution.)
- Install <a href = "https://nodejs.org/en">Node.js</a>. and its dependency <a href = "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/nodejs.install">Chocolatey</a>.
- Initialize the bots project using command npm init -y.
- Install nodemon using the terminal and the command npm install -g nodemon (nodemon installation allows the script to run continuously in the background while also autoupdating anytime script is changed in the bot project and saved allowing all changes to be quickly deployed for the bot).
- Install dotenv on using the terminal and the command npm install dotenv (This causes allows your bot project a place for the bots token to be stored later in the project and then be placed into a gitignore file in order to keep your token and other confidential project information safe if the bot is shared on GitHub.)
- Install discord.js using the terminal and the command npm i discord.js.
- Create a Discord bot on the Discord bot <a href = "https://discord.com/login?redirect_to=%2Fdevelopers%2Fapplications%2F">Discord Developer Portal</a>.
- Add the bot's token (Discord developer Portal-> application-> "specific app"-> bot -> Reset Token) to config.json and adjuste the configuration to indicate where the script is on your local machine.
- Run the bot by using nodemon or nodemon index.js or any other command you prefer.

## List of working features

# Fall 2024
## Description
- Discord is a communication platform designed for creating communities, where users can interact through text, voice, and video channels, while Discord bots are automated programs that can perform tasks such as moderating conversations, managing users, or providing entertainment within these communities. Our team has been tasked with creating a discord bot that can moderate servers. It is able to track activity across multiple channels and can purge users who have been deemed inactive for too long in order to keep the server lean. The main goal is to have this process done in an automated fashion periodically, and for the admins to be able to log into a dashboard to alter settings as needed.

      - Roles & Timers - displays two tables: User Roles and Role Timer. User Roles provides an overview of each individual users information, including their username, and user id, along with their role names (multiple roles if applicable) in the form of an interactive table. Role Timer an overview of the roles and timer for users within the application.

- Install <a href = "https://nodejs.org/en">Node.js</a>. and its dependency <a href = "https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/nodejs.install">Chocolatey</a>.
- [Removed: Initializing the bot manually is unnecessary with the current setup.] 
- Install nodemon using the terminal and the command npm install -g nodemon (nodemon installation allows the script to run continuously in the background while also autoupdating anytime script is changed in the bot project and saved allowing all changes to be quickly deployed for the bot).
- Create a Discord bot on the Discord bot <a href = "https://discord.com/login?redirect_to=%2Fdevelopers%2Fapplications%2F">Discord Developer Portal</a>.
- Add the bot's token (Discord developer Portal-> application-> "specific app"-> bot -> Reset Token) to config.json and adjuste the configuration to indicate where the script is on your local machine.
- Run the bot by using nodemon or nodemon index.js or any other command you prefer.
- Add database token (Go to your MongoDB account. Under 'Database' select Clusters. Select the corresponding DB, Select the Connect button. Under 'Connect to your application', select Drivers. Follow the instructions to complete the setup and get the token for the database.)
- Add guild id, in the Discord app, right-click on the Server Icon. Select copy Server ID.

   ### <ins>*Updates 2024*</ins>
- cd into src active directing for all installations from here.
- Install dotenv on using the terminal and the command `npm install dotenv` (This causes allows your bot project a place for the bots token to be stored later in the project and then be placed into a gitignore file in order to keep your token and other confidential       project information safe if the bot is shared on GitHub.)
- Install discord.js using the terminal and the command `npm i discord.js`.
- Install express.js using the terminal and the command `npm i express` (Allows for a simple web server framework to handle requests received from the frontend app.)
- Install mongoose using the terminal and the command `npm i mongoose` (Enables database integration with MongoDB so the app can read and write to the database.)
- Install cors using the terminal and the command `npm i cors` 
- Install axios using the terminal and the command `npm i axios` (Allows front end to fetch data from the server for displaying in the UI.)
- Install the react router dom using the terminal and the command `npm i react-router-dom` (Helps set up webpage routing on the server.)
- Install react scripts using the terminal and the command `npm i react-scripts` --save

## Setup Dotenv
- In the src folder, create a new file named .env which will hold the:
  - **TOKEN** (your discord bot token)
  - **databaseToken** (your MongoDB token)
  - **GUILD_ID** (your server id)
  - **CLIENT_ID** (found on the discord developer portal -> click the hamburger -> OAUth2 -> Client Information)
  - **CLIENT_SECRET** (found on the discord developer portal -> click the hamburger -> OAUth2 -> Client Information)
  - **REDIRECT_URI**  (found on the discord developer portal -> click the hamburger -> OAUth2 -> Redirects)

## How To Run
- From the src active directory, type `npm start` in the terminal and the bot, server, and react app will all start automatically. You will then see a login webpage appear in the browser automatically, presenting the admin login page for the dashboard.
- In your IDE terminal you will see logs to aid in tracing how the code runs
- In order to get past the admin login page, you must configure the .env with all the necessary fields

# Spring 2025
## :page_facing_up: Description
Discord is an instant messaging and social platform where users can communicate through text, voice chat, and video calls. Our team has been tasked with fixing bugs and implementing new features to the purging Discord bot.

As part of our Software Development II course with Dr. Anca Doloc-Mihu, we were tasked to work on the Discord Inactivity Purge Bot. This bot helps server owners maintain active and organized Discord communities by automatically removing users who have been inactive for a specified period. Key features include purge previews, inactivity warnings, and a customizable blacklist. The bot can be run manually or on a schedule. Through this project, we gained hands-on experience with full-stack development using Node.js, MongoDB, and React, along with HTML and CSS for building and styling the user interface.
